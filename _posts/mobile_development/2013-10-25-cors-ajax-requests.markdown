Modern browsers are configured to automatically dismiss HTTP requests made from one domain to another due to [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy). Since a Steroids WebView is effectively a full-screen WebKit-based browser, this means that you need to do some configuration to get your remote API requests working correctly. The easiest way to do this is to use [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

The basic trick is to add an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all HTTP responses from your server, enabling  The [enable-cors.org](http://enable-cors.org/) website has information on how to do this for various server environments. In addition, HTML5 Rocks has an excellent [CORS tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/) that works directly in Steroids – although you don't need the initial helper method code that handles platform differences, since the WebViews on all Steroids platforms support the [XMLHttpRequest2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/) object, which has CORS support. Thus, you can just use `xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()`.

## AppGyver Scanner's User Agent

Many default server configs (WordPress, Joomla etc) have security rules to fend off unwanted user agents. The `.htaccess` code they use is similar to the following:

{% highlight apache %}
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}
  (havij|libwww-perl|wget|python|nikto|curl|scan|java|winhttp|clshttp|loader) [NC,OR]
{% endhighlight %}

This default config has the word `|scan|` in it. Steroids injects the word "AppGyver Scanner" into the WebView's user agent, causing the server to dismiss the request. This can be fixed by removing the `|scan|` string from the config.
