#bold[#magenta[Basic usage commands]]:

  #bold[create] APP_PATH

    Creates a new application from default template.

  #bold[connect]]

    Starts server and allows to connect your iOS device or iOS Simulator to see your application.
    Provides further instructions for connecting and enters a console for accepting further commands.

    Options:

    #cyan[--port=4567]

      Sets the port for connecting devices.

    #cyan[--no-qrcode]

      Do not open a page with QR code.

    #cyan[--watch]

      Automatically push code to connected devices on file updates in app/, config/ or www/ directories.

      #cyan[--watchExclude=<path1,path2,path/to/file>] can be used to exclude paths and files, also see setting in application.coffee for permanent excludes

    #cyan[--serve]

      Starts a separate web server in http://localhost:4000 that serves files from dist/ for developing with a browser.
      When a push is made, the browser refreshes. #underline[Note:] this currently only works if connect is running on the default port.

      #cyan[--servePort=4000] can be used for setting the port for serve.

    #cyan[--deviceType=<device>]

      Specifies the type of iOS Simulator to launch inside connect. See "simulator" command for options.

    #cyan[--weinrePort=31173]

      If #bold[steroids weinre] is started with custom port, match that port here so that `connect` and `weinre` are in sync.


  #bold[push]]

    Pushes new version of your application to connected clients (iOS device or iOS Simulator).
    #underline[Note:] connect needs to be running for push to work.


#bold[#magenta[Other usage commands:]]

    Valid values for deviceType: #cyan[iphone, ipad, ipad_retina, iphone_retina_3_5_inch or iphone_retina_4_inch]

  #bold[weinre] #cyan[--port=31173]

    Starts Weinre debugger and waits for connections.

    #underline[Note:] if you start with other port than the default, you must also specify the same debug port for connect process, see #bold[connect] and #cyan[--weinrePort]
